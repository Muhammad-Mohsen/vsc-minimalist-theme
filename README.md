# VSCode Minimalist Theme

A minimalist dark theme for VSCode. Mostly based on the `Dark Modern` theme, but with a few tweaks:
- No drop shadows: menus and popups have no drop shadows.
- Consistent color palette. For example:
	- The Activity Bar active indicator is white.
	- Active tab and editor have the same background color.
